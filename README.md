# TicTacToe

## Technology Used 
   - C++

## Algorithm Used 
   - MiniMax

## MiniMax
 MiniMax is a kind of backtracking algorithm thata is used in decision making and game theory to find the optional move for a player, assuming that opponent plays 
 optimally. In MiniMax the two players are called maximizer and minimizer. The maximizer tries to get highest score possible while the minimizer tries to do the opposite  and get the lowest score possible.

## Working Mechanism
 The game is AI vs User. Computer tries to find the move before making a move. Maximizer tries to maximize the score move of Computer where minimizer tries to minimize 
 the score of user to find best move.
